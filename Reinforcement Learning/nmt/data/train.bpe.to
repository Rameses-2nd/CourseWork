▁Honestly , ▁I ▁wanted ▁something ▁I ▁had ▁the ▁think ▁even ▁less ▁about . ▁Skyla ▁is ▁more ▁effective , ▁lasts ▁three ▁years , ▁and ▁there ' s ▁almost ▁no ▁thought ▁to ▁it . ▁I ▁found ▁after ▁a ▁while ▁the ▁nuva ▁ring ▁started ▁to ▁make ▁my ▁vagina ▁smell ▁a ▁little ▁off . ▁Everyone ▁is ▁different , ▁and ▁this ▁wasn ' t ▁a ▁problem ▁until ▁about ▁1 2 ▁months ▁in . ▁Also ▁my ▁libido ▁lessened , ▁it ▁certainly ▁wasn ' t ▁non - existent ▁like ▁some ▁people ▁experience , ▁but ▁it ▁certainly ▁wasn ' t ▁anywhere ▁near ▁as ▁high .

▁The ▁race ▁is ▁held ▁on ▁the ▁oldest ▁race ▁track ▁used ▁in ▁automobile ▁racing . ▁Races ▁have ▁been ▁held ▁there ▁since ▁1 9 0 9 ▁with ▁the ▁first ▁5 0 0 ▁occurring ▁in ▁1 9 1 1 .
▁Correct . ▁First ▁floor ▁was ▁easy , ▁second ▁floor ▁was ▁a ▁challenge . ▁: )

▁It ' s ▁like ▁people ▁haven ' t ▁actually ▁watched ▁the ▁marines . ▁They ▁constantly ▁ADS ▁in ▁all ▁of ▁the ▁games .
▁In ▁his ▁defense ▁I ▁don ' t ▁recall ▁him ▁saying ▁anything ▁racist . ▁He ▁first ▁posted ▁about ▁Gamergate ▁in ▁Bitcoin ▁and ▁used ▁the ▁' asablackman ' ▁thing ▁to ▁show ▁that ▁they ▁had ▁minorities ▁in ▁the ▁movement . ▁In ▁reality ▁he ▁just ▁validated ▁peoples ▁claim ▁that ▁GG ▁had ▁people ▁pretend ▁to ▁be ▁black ▁in ▁order ▁to ▁not ▁look ▁racist .
▁There ' s ▁plenty ▁of ▁justification . ▁I ▁would ▁rate ▁it ▁at ▁least ▁as ▁good ▁as ▁Dresden . ▁It ' s ▁a ▁bit ▁more ▁' real ' ▁( as ▁real ▁as ▁it ▁can ▁be ▁with ▁ghosts , ▁zombies , ▁etc . ) ▁and ▁the ▁stakes ▁are ▁usually ▁more ▁personal . ▁Harry ▁does ▁indeed ▁have ▁the ▁weight ▁of ▁the ▁universe ▁on ▁his ▁back , ▁but ▁when ▁Felix ▁screws ▁up ▁he ▁breaks ▁those ▁closest ▁to ▁him . ▁newlinechar ▁newlinechar ▁Overall ▁the ▁Castor - verse ▁feels ▁a ▁little ▁nastier ▁all ▁over , ▁the ▁atmosphere ▁more ▁overbearing . ▁It ' s ▁not ▁as ▁much ▁escapist ▁fun ▁as ▁Dresden , ▁but ▁there ' s ▁so ▁much ▁cathars is ▁when ▁you ▁get ▁through ▁to ▁the ▁other ▁side . ▁newlinechar ▁newlinechar ▁Like ▁yourself , ▁I ▁love ▁them ▁both .

▁By ▁playing ▁safely ▁he ▁means ▁proper ▁positioning ▁and ▁avoiding ▁skillshots ▁and ▁damage ▁during ▁team ▁fights , ▁good ▁trading ▁things ▁like ▁that . ▁But ▁you ▁will ▁have ▁to ▁take ▁risks , ▁and ▁push ▁what ▁you ▁think ▁your ▁capable ▁of ▁to ▁see ▁how ▁good ▁you ▁are . ▁I ▁know ▁I ' m ▁in ▁trouble ▁right ▁now ▁because ▁I ▁usually ▁play ▁too ▁safe ▁through ▁landing ▁and ▁am ▁now ▁not ▁quite ▁sure ▁what ▁I ' m ▁capable ▁of . ▁Take ▁some ▁risks , ▁you ' ll ▁learn ▁faster , ▁and ▁losses ▁are ▁OK .
▁That ' s ▁so ▁fucking ▁weird

▁I ▁never ▁understood ▁what ▁people ▁love ▁so ▁much ▁about ▁1 4 ▁ARR , ▁am ▁i ▁missing ▁something ? ▁The ▁combat ▁in ▁particular ▁is ▁so ▁mundane ▁and ▁goes ▁unchanged ▁for ▁tens ▁of ▁levels ▁at ▁a ▁time . ▁I ▁tried ▁rogue ▁lancer ▁and ▁thaumaturge ▁past ▁level ▁2 5 . ▁thaumaturge ▁being ▁my ▁favourite
