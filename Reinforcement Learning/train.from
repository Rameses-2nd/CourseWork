It isn't that 'puberty sucks.'

We don't need to be throwing more to be more productive in the passing game. Bevell is VERY prone to do deep timing routes even though our OLine has severe protection issues which take forever to pan out and end up with Russell just scrambling around trying to do something. Some of his plays leave me scratching my head even nowadays. He is also prone to do 4/5 WR sets constantly in the redzone instead of pounding the rock. Our teams stats in the redzone show a team that can move down the field pretty easily but we stall in the redzone quite often.  newlinechar  newlinechar Now to give Bevell some leeway the receivers this year have been prone to drops. Willson and Kearse have dropped several this year at key moments. Those drops though don't change the fact that his plays are weird. I will be happy to see him gone and give a new OC a shot now.

The thing I like about it is that it's 'real', compared to most anime.  I do NOT mean real as in 'An accurate representation of reality', but as in 'Not including magical schoolgirls and people flying through the air and hovering in drama poses and transforming into vampire tentacle monsters and such'.  I don't watch much anime, mostly because 99% of what I see all looks like the latter category, to me.  Initial D, by contrast, gives me young street racers doing (semi)real things with real cars and no one's developed the ability to change into a ninja superheroine yet, so it's a world that I recognize and relate to.

North Koreans aren't completely inept people,   they understand modern society better than you imply.   They have access to technology and information from across the borders.

It's a difference in culture and understanding of society but that's much less of a problem than you suggest. newlinechar  newlinechar The economics is a problem,  however, if NK fell swiftly and was taken on by the south,  I think that the industries that exist presently could be repurposed rapidly to provide a much better economic state for the north.

I disagree. These people are, by design, immune to criticism. They just shout bull shit and don't listen to anyone. Plus, they are inherently unreasonable and unwilling to play by standard logic. This means words have no effect on them. Alternatively getting angry or, worse, physical/violent with them just validates in their eyes what they are saying and makes you worse than them.  newlinechar  newlinechar However, with a little girl most of this manipulation is no longer effective. What's he going to do, argue with her? Is he going to try to explain the 'word of the lawd' to her? Is he going to try to make her feel guilty about sins or whatever bull shit angle he would normally take? No, he can't do that. It wouldn't work and besides, doing any of this would move him from obnoxious pest to a scary threat to children if he starts lambasting a child.  newlinechar  newlinechar So what we have here is a menace who usually has society backed against the ropes as he takes advantage of his freedoms and a little girl using her societal advantages shouting him down. It's certainly not the most satisfying justice I've ever seen but it's rare that people like this can be neutralized in any sense. To that extent, it is still pretty sweet to watch even if only in small doses.

That's along the lines of what I was thinking as well. No sense of urgency.
We don't need to be throwing more to be more productive in the passing game. Bevell is VERY prone to do deep timing routes even though our OLine has severe protection issues which take forever to pan out and end up with Russell just scrambling around trying to do something. Some of his plays leave me scratching my head even nowadays. He is also prone to do 4/5 WR sets constantly in the redzone instead of pounding the rock. Our teams stats in the redzone show a team that can move down the field pretty easily but we stall in the redzone quite often.  newlinechar  newlinechar Now to give Bevell some leeway the receivers this year have been prone to drops. Willson and Kearse have dropped several this year at key moments. Those drops though don't change the fact that his plays are weird. I will be happy to see him gone and give a new OC a shot now.

Oh, I thought you said you were sad that *I* didn't understand a reference. newlinechar  newlinechar The Cartesian plane is just the X and Y coordinate system in math. A function with a completely straight, vertical line means that the function is undefined. newlinechar  newlinechar It's funnier because technically, an undefined function is *any* function where the x coordinates overlap (such as (3,5) and (3,8)). Like a squiggle, or an oval.
The thing I like about it is that it's 'real', compared to most anime.  I do NOT mean real as in 'An accurate representation of reality', but as in 'Not including magical schoolgirls and people flying through the air and hovering in drama poses and transforming into vampire tentacle monsters and such'.  I don't watch much anime, mostly because 99% of what I see all looks like the latter category, to me.  Initial D, by contrast, gives me young street racers doing (semi)real things with real cars and no one's developed the ability to change into a ninja superheroine yet, so it's a world that I recognize and relate to.

&gt; Well there's a reason mainstream is mainstream and ug is ug. newlinechar  newlinechar True, but that reason is NOT quality newlinechar  newlinechar All I'm saying people's time would be better spent listening to something (doesn't even have to be from 2014) they've never heard before than complaining that Kanye, Kendrick or Chance didn't release anything. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Its pretty hard to say it was a good year for hip-hop when most of majority of most peoples favorite artists didnt come out with anything.  newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe, but we're arguing quality here, and in my opinion, ignoring the lines that designate mainstream from ug, there was plenty shit that I consider quality, even compared to last year.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is ALL my opinion though

North Koreans aren't completely inept people,   they understand modern society better than you imply.   They have access to technology and information from across the borders.    It isn't so disparate that it's not unlike moving from say Germany to Czech Republic, or US to Spain.   It's a difference in culture and understanding of society but that's much less of a problem than you suggest. newlinechar  newlinechar The economics is a problem,  however, if NK fell swiftly and was taken on by the south,  I think that the industries that exist presently could be repurposed rapidly to provide a much better economic state for the north.

I'm all for turning a race into a fun run but the moment you start cutting big swatches out of the course you are potentially putting others at risk should you get injured running off course and need medical assistance. They did get what they deserved, and even today it doesn't bother me as much as it did that day. I guess come down to it, it was just the tone they set as they saw others struggling. Almost like they were mocking us. Either way, I got my finish. And they got asked to leave for being immature. No harm, no foul

He never apologized to the guy and he does not keep in touch with him. The man did not even know his attacker was Mark Wahlberg.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has been the FPS in the last years that captured me the most. I miss those times :(
There is probably a short transitioning period. I remember when whe changed to euro when i was a kid. It was tough bit to swallow for older people as it was more difficult for them to learn a new currency. A middle-aged lady who had a kiosk near to us reassured us when we were buying sweets that we could either pay in euros in in 'Finnish money'.
I know that feeling. Ever since I lost my mattress, I feel like everything else is just inferior, haha. I'm sleeping on a pillow top thing right now, and it just ain't right, I tell you hwat.

Standard practice in the UK. Get breathalyzed and are 'over the limit' the morning after drinking? Demand a blood test at the station as you don't think the read out is correct. Wait an hour or two for a doctor to show up to perform the blood test. Miraculously end up under the limit ;)

Brocialism is a brocial and broconomic system characterized by brocial ownership of the means of broduction and co-operative management of the broconomy as well as a brolitical theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Brocial ownership' may refer to cooperative enterprises (ragers, keggers, hospital visits, etc), common ownership (brotein powder, pizza, weights), or any combination of these. newlinechar  newlinechar There are many varieties of brocialism and there is no single definition encapsulating the boundlessness nature of brociety.

This season was exciting till December. We gave the packers and Broncos a run for their money and beat the patriots. Phillip is just so boring. I agree with you about the bullying scandal.

There is a consistent theme from all of Adnan's friends that show they did not see anything 'off' about Adnan.

I have been seeing the -1 for a while.   Maybe Blizzard is hoping 26 man raids are the new thing in 2015
I disagree. These people are, by design, immune to criticism. They just shout bull shit and don't listen to anyone. Plus, they are inherently unreasonable and unwilling to play by standard logic. This means words have no effect on them. Alternatively getting angry or, worse, physical/violent with them just validates in their eyes what they are saying and makes you worse than them.  newlinechar  newlinechar However, with a little girl most of this manipulation is no longer effective. What's he going to do, argue with her? Is he going to try to explain the 'word of the lawd' to her? Is he going to try to make her feel guilty about sins or whatever bull shit angle he would normally take? No, he can't do that. It wouldn't work and besides, doing any of this would move him from obnoxious pest to a scary threat to children if he starts lambasting a child.  newlinechar  newlinechar So what we have here is a menace who usually has society backed against the ropes as he takes advantage of his freedoms and a little girl using her societal advantages shouting him down. It's certainly not the most satisfying justice I've ever seen but it's rare that people like this can be neutralized in any sense. To that extent, it is still pretty sweet to watch even if only in small doses.

The major reason for this is 1) aiming, negated by the fact the have an amazing HUD. 2) stability against recoil, negated by the fact they weigh as much as a big ass truck. Marines/ODST still shoulder, as they're not armored and their HUD is mostly something done for speed over accuracy. If ADS belonged anywhere in Halo, it should have been done in ODST.

Holy books are written as allegory, you're not meant to take them literally. Take the message behind the stories, the stories themselves are just a vehicle for the message. The book was written down by mortal men, and you should not let a man tell you how to have a relationship with your God. That's between you and God, and should not be subject to the interpretation of some other human that you take as inherited wisdom. Do not let other men speak for your God. Commune with God in ways you feel are appropriate to your psychology.
